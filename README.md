# gig-finder

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0. It allows users to find music events close to their location wherever they are in the world. I am using an API to pull nearest events for a user.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
